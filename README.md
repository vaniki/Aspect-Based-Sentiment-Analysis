# Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains parts of the code I developed while working on my thesis
['Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis on Online Reviews using Machine and Deep Learning'](https://science.vu.nl/en/Images/stageverslag-vatzola_tcm296-951867.pdf)
.

The datasets come from [Task 5 of SemEval 2016](https://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task5/).

The code is using the 300d, 2.2M vocab GloVe pre-trained word vector acquired
from [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
and the pre-trained domain specific word embeddings from the work 'Double Embeddings and CNN-based Sequence Labeling for
Aspect Extraction
' by Xu et al. located [here](https://howardhsu.github.io/) under the paper title.

Details about the models can be found in the thesis report.
